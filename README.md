This repository contains code accompanying the paper "On convergence rates of ensemble Kalman inversion for linear ill-posed problems"

You can reproduce all figures at once by executing the script "make_plots.sh". 
Depending on your computer, this might take considerable time.
The figures will not look exactly the same since the algorithms are stochastic.
